Continuous Monitoring:

Overview of continuous monitoring
 ● Continuous monitoring is a practice in DevOps that involves the continuous collection, analysis, and visualization of system and application metrics to ensure the health, performance, and availability of software systems. 
● It enables real-time monitoring and proactive detection of issues, allowing for timely remediation and optimization. 
● Continuous monitoring involves the use of monitoring tools and techniques to collect and analyze data from various sources, including servers, applications, databases, network devices, and other components of the IT infrastructure. 
● The goal is to gain insights into system behavior, identify bottlenecks or anomalies, and take necessary actions to maintain system performance and reliability.

Key Components of Continuous Monitoring: 

1. Data Collection: Continuous monitoring relies on the collection of relevant data points and metrics from different sources, including servers, applications, and infrastructure components. This data can be collected through various monitoring agents, APIs, log files, or other data collection mechanisms. 

2. Data Analysis: The collected data is analyzed to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies. Statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms may be applied to detect performance issues, security threats, or potential failures. 

3. Alerting and Notifications: Continuous monitoring systems are configured to generate alerts and notifications when predefined thresholds or conditions are met. This allows for timely intervention and response to critical events or issues.

4. . Visualization and Dashboards: Continuous monitoring tools provide visualization capabilities to present the collected data in a meaningful and easily understandable manner. Dashboards and reports provide real-time insights into system performance, health, and key metrics.

5. Automated Actions: Continuous monitoring is not just about observing and analyzing data but also about taking automated actions based on predefined rules or policies. These actions can include scaling resources, restarting services, triggering alarms, or notifying relevant stakeholders

 Benefits of Continuous Monitoring: 

1. Early detection of issues: Continuous monitoring enables the timely detection of performance
bottlenecks, security vulnerabilities, and system failures, allowing for immediate remediation actions.
 2. Proactive problem resolution: By continuously monitoring system metrics and analyzing trends, teams can proactively identify and address potential problems before they impact end users. 
3. Improved system performance and reliability: Continuous monitoring helps in optimizing system performance, ensuring optimal resource utilization, and maintaining high availability

4. Enhanced security: Continuous monitoring enables the detection of security threats, unauthorized access attempts, or unusual activities, facilitating a quick response to protect sensitive data and systems. 
5. Data-driven decision-making: Continuous monitoring provides valuable insights into system behavior and performance trends, enabling informed decision-making for capacity planning, infrastructure optimization, and resource allocation. 
6. Compliance and regulatory adherence: Continuous monitoring helps organizations meet compliance requirements by monitoring and reporting on key metrics related to security, privacy, and data integrity.

Continuous monitoring tools in DevOps 

There are several popular continuous monitoring tools used in DevOps. Here are some examples: 
1. Prometheus: Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit that is widely used in DevOps environments. It provides a flexible and scalable platform for monitoring metrics, collecting time-series data, and generating alerts based on predefined rules.
 2. Grafana: Grafana is an open-source data visualization and monitoring tool that works seamlessly with Prometheus and other data sources. It allows you to create interactive dashboards and visualizations to monitor and analyze your metrics in real-time.
 3. ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana): The ELK Stack is a popular combination of open-source tools used for log monitoring and analysis. Elasticsearch is a distributed search and analytics engine, Logstash is a data processing pipeline, and Kibana is a data visualization and exploration tool. Together, they provide a powerful solution for monitoring and analyzing logs.

Some of the key attributes that are monitored include: 

1. System Metrics: These include CPU usage, memory utilization, disk space, network traffic, and other system-level metrics. Monitoring these attributes helps identify resource bottlenecks, capacity issues, and potential system failures.

 2. Application Performance Metrics: This includes metrics related to response time, throughput, latency, error rates, and other performance indicators specific to the application or service being monitored. Monitoring these metrics helps identify performance issues, bottlenecks, and areas for optimization.

 3. Infrastructure Metrics: This includes metrics related to infrastructure components such as servers, databases, load balancers, and other networking devices. Monitoring infrastructure metrics helps ensure the availability, reliability, and performance of the underlying infrastructure. 

4. Logs and Events: Monitoring logs and events generated by systems and applications provides valuable insights into system behavior, error messages, security events, and other important events. Monitoring logs helps detect anomalies, troubleshoot issues, and ensure compliance with security and regulatory requirements. 

5. Security Metrics: This includes monitoring for security-related events, vulnerabilities, and threats. It involves monitoring network traffic, access logs, system logs, and other security-related metrics to detect and respond to security incidents in real-time. 

6. Business Metrics: Monitoring business metrics allows organizations to track key performance indicators (KPIs) and business goals. These metrics may include user engagement, conversion rates, revenue, customer satisfaction, and other business-specific metrics.

To install and configure Prometheus and Grafana as monitoring and visualization tools, you can follow the steps below:

Create a system user for Prometheus using below commnds:
sudo useradd --no-create-home --shell /bin/false prometheus

Create the directories in which we will be storing our configuration files and libraries:
sudo mkdir /etc/prometheus
sudo mkdir /var/lib/prometheus
Set the ownership of the /var/lib/prometheus directory with below command:
sudo chown prometheus:prometheus /var/lib/prometheus
You need to inside /tmp :
cd /tmp/
Go to official pgae downloads Prometheus:

https://prometheus.io/download/#prometheus

# wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v3.0.0/prometheus-3.0.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz

# sudo tar -xvf prometheus-3.0.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
Move the configuration file and set the owner to the prometheus
cd prometheus-2.47.2.linux-amd64
sudo mv promotool /etc/prometheus
sudo mv prometheus.yml /etc/prometheus
sudo chown -R prometheus:prometheus /etc/prometheus
Move the binaries and set the owner:
sudo mv prometheus /usr/local/bin/
sudo chown prometheus:prometheus /usr/local/bin/prometheus
Create the service file using below command:
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/prometheus.service
[Unit]
Description=Prometheus
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=prometheus
Group=prometheus
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/prometheus \
    --config.file /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
    --storage.tsdb.path /var/lib/prometheus/ \
    --web.console.templates=/etc/prometheus/consoles \
    --web.console.libraries=/etc/prometheus/console_libraries

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

Reload systemd:
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

Start and enable Prometheus service:
sudo systemctl start prometheus
sudo systemctl enable prometheus
sudo systemctl status prometheus
Now access Prometehus in your browser
<server-ip>:9090


Step #2:Install Node Exporter on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
# wget https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/download/v1.8.2/node_exporter-1.8.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz
# sudo tar xvfz node_exporter-*.*-amd64.tar.gz

Move the binary file of node exporter to /usr/local/bin location.
sudo mv node_exporter-*.*-amd64/node_exporter /usr/local/bin/

Create a node_exporter user to run the node exporter service
sudo useradd -rs /bin/false node_exporter
Create a Custom Node Exporter Service
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/node_exporter.service
[Unit]

Description=Node Exporter

=======================
Reload the systemd
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

To Start, enable node exporter:
sudo systemctl enable node_exporter
sudo systemctl start node_exporter
sudo systemctl status node_exporter
Lets update our configuration file using below command:
sudo nano /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
- job_name: 'Node_Exporter'

    scrape_interval: 5s

    static_configs:

      - targets: ['<Server_IP_of_Node_Exporter_Machine>:9100']

Save the file

After changes any configuration file we need to restart our prometheus
sudo systemctl restart prometheus.service

Step #3:Install Grafana on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
Download the Grafana GPG key with wget, then pipe the output to apt-key. This will add the key to your APT installation’s list of trusted keys, which will allow you to download and verify the GPG-signed Grafana package:

sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https software-properties-common wget
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings/
wget -q -O - https://apt.grafana.com/gpg.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/grafana.gpg > /dev/null
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/grafana.gpg] https://apt.grafana.com stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/grafana.list

# Updates the list of available packages
sudo apt-get update

# Installs the latest OSS release:
sudo apt-get install grafana

Once Grafana is installed, use systemctl to start the Grafana server:
sudo systemctl start grafana-server
Next, verify that Grafana is running by checking the service’s status:
sudo systemctl status grafana-server
sudo systemctl enable grafana-server
Lets Access in browser:
<instance_ip>:3000

=========================================================
HELM:
=====================


On linux OS we have package managers like yum or apt which we use to isntall package


 like:  yum install git
          apt-get install httpd




Helm is a package manager of kubernetes which comes with set of YAML files (pre-written) which when executed will install softwares or tools on the kubernetes cluster


So if we have to install open source tools or applications on kubernetes cluster we can use HELM




Install using Helm
===========================
Add helm repo


# helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts


Update helm repo


# helm repo update


Install helm


# helm install prometheus prometheus-community/prometheus


Expose Prometheus Service


This is required to access prometheus-server using your browser.


# kubectl expose service prometheus-server --type=NodePort --target-port=9090 --name=prometheus-server-ext


In the kubernetes master node run the queries


# kubectl get pods


# kubectl get svc


Go to the browser:


take the public ip of the masternode and nodeport number


example: http://34.170.213.215:31753/


You will see prometheous dashboard


Now Execute below queries to complete assignment:


kube_pod_container_resource_limits




Grafana:


Install using Helm
Add helm repo
helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts


Update helm repo
helm repo update


Install helm
helm install grafana grafana/grafana




Username is admin and get password by running below command:


kubectl get secret --namespace default grafana -o jsonpath="{.data.admin-password}" | base64 --decode ; echo




GzaEYYDkLjgCxO1rPYt1ZiVNh6O4Y4hdkJ9q5Bm6




Expose Grafana Service
kubectl expose service grafana --type=NodePort --target-port=3000 --name=grafana-ext




Loginto grafana: username will be admin and password will be the text that we copied earlier


Step 1: In grafana we will now setup the Data source:
==================================
Click on Data source --> scroll down -- to add prometheous URL field. Copy the prometheous dashboard URL -> https://ipaddress:portnumber


Scroll down --> click on save and test


Grafana will now be able to fetch data from prometheous


Step 2: Import dashboard to display the Data


Go to Homepage of grafana --> click on Dashboards --> Click on Import dashboard --> the id of dashboard is 16734 and click on load


Scroll down and select prometheous data source -> click on Import






Assignment 1:
====================
Use dashboard, 16734 and add the alert


Assignment 2: Create your own dashboard
=====================
