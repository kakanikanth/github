Hello Everyone!

Trainer: Sonal Mittal

Agenda: Day 1 - 20 Feb 2024 - Version control with Git and GitHub 
===============================

> Introduction to Version Control 
> Benefits of Version Control 
> Types of Version Control Systems 
> Git and its features
> Git workflow and architecture
> Execute git commands on Local Repository




What is Version Control?
================================
Version: Making changes and tracking(who did the change and when )these changes on a file or set of files

Control: How do we track the changes ? where do we track the changes ?
> Use a tool that will automatically track every change your do to a file or set of files .
> Version control tool will provide you a repository to contribute together 
> Multiple team members to work together on same unit of information (same file)



If we have NO Version Control :

1. We will have to rework on the files that we have not saved or changes that were not saved earlier.
2. We will not have a common folder/location where all the team members can contribute
3. We will not have a tool or a process to share data between team members


Benefits of Version Control:
===================================

> Track Changes 
> Back Up of our files and code 
> Collaboration
> roll back to previous changes 
> Complete snapshot of the project 

Types of Version Control System:
=============================================
> Local Version Control  System:
=================================
RCS : revision control system 

Disadvantage: Local to the developer, others cannot access the files 
If machine crashes we will lose the actual files as well as the versioned files.

> Central version control Systems:
=====================================
SVN, perforce, TFS , googledrive


Disadvantage: 
> if no internet, we cannot access the versioned files 
> if central crashes.. all version are deleted.

> Distributed Version Control System 
=======================================
Local + Central repository

GIT:
=========================================
Git is an Open source tool 
It is available for free 
You can download it on windows mac or linux 
It is always installed on the local machine of the developer
It is Command line tool - provides simple commands to version control files in local machine
Git also has a user interface - provided only for windows OS
Git is also integrated with code editors
Git is used to create local repository 
Git is used to version control files and maintain them to local repo 

=============================================

Demo: 

# sudo su -

Step 1: Create a working directory 

# mkdir myproject && cd myproject

# touch index1.html index2.html

Step 2: Create a local repository  - Initialized empty Git repository

# git init 

# ls -al 

.git : name of local repository 
do not change the name -> always it will be same.

Step 3: Setup git configuration for git logging 

# git config --global user.name sonal04

# git config --global user.email admin@gmail.com

These configuration get stored in the below file 

# cat ~/.gitconfig

[user]
        email = admin@gmail.com
        name = sonal04

These configuration are done only 1 time .

Step 4: check the status of working directory 

# git status 

Step 5: Add the files to staging area 

# git add index1.html 

# git status 

Step 6: Commit the files into Local repo 

# git commit -m "added file index1.html" 

-m - give any message in double quotes

Step 7: Git log command to give history of commits performed

#  git log

Step 8: 
Create a file and add it to staging area .
Can we bring it back to unstaged area(red) - yes you can 
using restore command 

# touch file.php

# git add .

# git status

# git restore --staged file.php
